#### <u>Definition 1</u>
Federated learning is a way of training machine learning models without having to share the data samples. Instead, each device or node trains a local model on its own data and only sends the model parameters to a central server. The server then combines the parameters from different nodes to create a global model that is shared by all nodes. This way, the data privacy and security of each node is preserved, and the communication cost is reduced. Federated learning can be useful for applications that involve sensitive or decentralized data, such as healthcare, smart home, or industrial IoT

#### <u>Definition  2</u>
It is a decentralized machine learning approach that enables model training across multiple devices or edge nodes without the need to share raw data centrally. In this paradigm, instead of sending raw data from user devices to a central server for training, the model is sent to the devices themselves, and the training process occurs locally on each device. Only the model updates, not the raw data, are shared back to a central server or coordinator.
