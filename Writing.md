### Title: Data-Aware Device Scheduling for Federated Edge Learning

---

#### Introduction
- **Context**: Discusses Federated Edge Learning (FEEL) as a means to collaboratively train machine learning models across edge devices.
- **Challenges Highlighted**:
  - Limited communication bandwidth.
  - Diverse data distribution across devices.
- **Solution Proposed**: A new scheduling algorithm that prioritizes devices based on the diversity of their data.

---

#### Background and Related Work
- **FEEL Overview**: Distributed machine learning that keeps data localized while benefiting from aggregated learning.
- **Existing Problems**:
  - Efficiency losses due to diverse and limited device capabilities.
  - Previous research focused mainly on optimizing resource usage, not data diversity.
- **Motivation for This Work**: Addressing the need for scheduling algorithms that consider data diversity and device capabilities comprehensively.

  - Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) server.
  - Edge devices with local datasets.
- **Key Formulations**:
  - **Device Selection**: Prioritize devices for participation based on a composite diversity index.
  - **Bandwidth Allocation**: Manage network resources to optimize data transmission efficiency.

---

#### Scheduling Algorithm
- **Two Subproblems**:
  - **Sub1**: Device Selection - Select devices based on energy usage, training, and transmission times, weighted by their data diversity.
  - **Sub2**: Bandwidth Allocation - Allocate bandwidth efficiently among selected devices to minimize energy consumption and maximize throughput.
- **Iterative Approach**: Solve Sub1 and Sub2 iteratively to adapt to dynamic network conditions and device availability.

---

#### Conclusion
- **Achievements**: Developed a data-aware scheduling algorithm that improves the efficiency and effectiveness of FEEL.
